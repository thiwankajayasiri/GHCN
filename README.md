## Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)

The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) is an integrated database of climate summaries from land surface stations across the globe that have been subjected to a common suite of quality assurance reviews. 
The data are obtained from more than 20 sources. Some data are more than 175 years old while others are less than an hour old. 
GHCN is the official archived dataset, and it serves as a replacement product for older NCEI-maintained datasets that are designated for daily temporal resolution 
(i.e., DSI 3200, DSI 3201, DSI 3202, DSI 3205, DSI 3206, DSI 3208, DSI 3210, etc.).
